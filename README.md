# ESP32_CYD_Weather_Station_With_Forecast-main
   The code is not written by me, but from Daniel Eichhorn (https://blog.squix.ch) and was    adapted by Bodmer as an example for his OpenWeather library (https://github.com/Bodmer/OpenWeather/).    I modified this sketch and icons for landscape display, added WiFi strength function and a 4-pixel circle to show data was refreshed.
   Feel free to correct of modify.
